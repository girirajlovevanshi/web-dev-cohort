# Averages, Mixtures, and Allegation - Aptitude Guide

## **1. Averages**
### **Definition:**
The average (arithmetic mean) of a given set of numbers is the sum of all numbers divided by the total count of numbers.

### **Formula:**
```
Average = (Sum of all values) / (Total number of values)
```

### **Examples:**
1. Find the average of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25.
   - Sum = 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 75
   - Number of values = 5
   - **Average = 75 / 5 = 15**

2. The average age of 30 students is 16 years. If the teacher‚Äôs age (40 years) is included, find the new average.
   - New total sum = (30 * 16) + 40 = 480 + 40 = 520
   - New number of people = 31
   - **New average = 520 / 31 = 16.77**

## **2. Mixtures and Allegation**
### **Mixtures**
Mixtures involve combining two or more elements in different quantities. The goal is often to find the proportion or final concentration.

### **Formula:**
```
Final Quantity = Sum of all individual quantities
```

#### **Example:**
A milkman mixes 4 liters of water with 16 liters of milk. Find the percentage of milk in the mixture.
   - Total mixture = 16 + 4 = 20 liters
   - Percentage of milk = (16/20) * 100 = **80%**

### **Allegation Rule**
Allegation is a technique to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients at different costs are mixed to get a desired cost.

#### **Formula:**
```
Ratio = (Higher quantity - Mean quantity) / (Mean quantity - Lower quantity)
```

#### **Example:**
A shopkeeper mixes sugar worth ‚Çπ40/kg with sugar worth ‚Çπ60/kg to get a mixture costing ‚Çπ50/kg. Find the ratio.
   - Using the formula:
   - Ratio = (60 - 50) / (50 - 40) = 10 / 10 = **1:1**
   - **So, the two types of sugar should be mixed in a 1:1 ratio.**

## **3. Practice Questions:**
1. Find the average of 8, 12, 20, and 24.

2. The average of 6 numbers is 15. If one number (30) is removed, find the new average.

3. A class has 40 students, and their average score is 70. If 10 students with an average score of 90 join, what is the new class average?

4. A 40-liter solution has 25% alcohol. How much water must be added to make it a 20% alcohol solution?

5. A shopkeeper mixes rice costing ‚Çπ50/kg with rice costing ‚Çπ80/kg to get a mixture worth ‚Çπ60/kg. Find the mixing ratio.

6. A trader mixes 10 liters of oil worth ‚Çπ90 per liter with 20 liters of oil worth ‚Çπ60 per liter. Find the price per liter of the final mixture.

7. A person travels 60 km at 40 km/h and then 90 km at 60 km/h. Find the average speed.

8. A can contains 20 liters of milk. If 5 liters are replaced with water, and this process is repeated again, find the final quantity of milk in the can.

9. In a mixture of 60 liters, the ratio of milk to water is 2:1. How much water should be added to make the ratio 1:1?
10. The average salary of 15 employees is ‚Çπ25,000. If the manager‚Äôs salary is included, the new average is ‚Çπ27,000. Find the manager‚Äôs salary.
11. A solution has 30% salt. If 10 liters of water is added to 20 liters of this solution, find the new salt percentage.
12. Two types of tea, one costing ‚Çπ100/kg and another ‚Çπ150/kg, are mixed in a 2:3 ratio. Find the price of the mixture.

4. 10 litr
5. 2:1
6. 70
7. 78
### **Solution for Question 8:**  
A can contains **20 liters of milk**. If **5 liters are replaced with water**, and this process is **repeated again**, we use the formula:  

```md
Final Milk Quantity = Initial Quantity √ó (1 - Replacement Quantity / Total Quantity)‚Åø
```

#### **Where:**  
- Initial Quantity = **20 liters**  
- Replacement Quantity = **5 liters**  
- Total Quantity = **20 liters**  
- n = **2 times**  

```md
Final Milk = 20 √ó (1 - 5/20)¬≤  
           = 20 √ó (3/4)¬≤  
           = 20 √ó 9/16  
           = 11.25 liters  
```

```java
**Final quantity of milk = 11.25 liters**
```

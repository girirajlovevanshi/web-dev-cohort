Since Git is detecting `light-drag-onoff` as an embedded Git repository, so i need to **properly add it as a submodule**.
and i learn a new thing here is,

### ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Guide to Adding it as a Submodule**
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Remove the Existing Folder from Git Index (if needed)**
Since Git already recognizes it as an embedded repo, remove it from tracking before adding it as a submodule.

```bash
git rm --cached "Cohort-track/week07 22Feb-28Feb/day24/alumini-help/light-drag-onoff"
```

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Add it as a Submodule**
Now, add `light-drag-onoff` as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add <repo-url> "Cohort-track/week07 22Feb-28Feb/day24/alumini-help/light-drag-onoff"
```

Replace `<repo-url>` with the actual repository URL for `light-drag-onoff`.

For example:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/your-username/light-drag-onoff.git "Cohort-track/week07 22Feb-28Feb/day24/alumini-help/light-drag-onoff"
```

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Commit the Changes**
Once added, commit the submodule reference:

```bash
git add .gitmodules "Cohort-track/week07 22Feb-28Feb/day24/alumini-help/light-drag-onoff"
git commit -m "Added light-drag-onoff as a submodule"
git push origin main
```

---

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository with Submodules (for Future Use)**
If someone clones your repository, they should use:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <your-repo-url>
```

If they have already cloned it, they can run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

### üöÄ **Final Check**
Run:
```bash
git submodule status
```
If `light-drag-onoff` appears in the list, it is successfully added as a submodule! üéâ

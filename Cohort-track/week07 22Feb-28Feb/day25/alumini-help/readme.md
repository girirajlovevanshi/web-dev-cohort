Since Git is detecting `light-drag-onoff` as an embedded Git repository, so i need to **properly add it as a submodule**.
and i learn a new thing from fresh, so if you also want to learn, I'll guide you step by step to **add a Git submodule properly** and ensure it works without issues. ðŸš€  

---

### âœ… **Step 1: Navigate to Your Main Repository**
First, go to your main repo folder where you want to add the submodule:  
```bash
cd /e/Projects/web-dev-cohort
```
Ensure your working directory is clean:
```bash
git status
```

---

### âœ… **Step 2: Add the Submodule**
Run the following command to add the Git submodule:  
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/Muksiduz/light-drag-onoff "Cohort-track/week07 22Feb-28Feb/day25/alumini-help/light-drag-onoff"
```
This will:  
- Clone the submodule repository inside the given path  
- Track it as a submodule  

---

### âœ… **Step 3: Initialize and Update the Submodule**
Run the following command to make sure the submodule is properly set up:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

### âœ… **Step 4: Commit and Push the Changes**
After adding the submodule, you need to commit the changes:
```bash
git add .gitmodules Cohort-track/week07\ 22Feb-28Feb/day25/alumini-help/light-drag-onoff
git commit -m "Added light-drag-onoff as a submodule"
git push origin main
```

---

### âœ… **Step 5: Verify the Submodule**
To check if the submodule is correctly linked, run:
```bash
git submodule status
```
It should show the submodule with its commit hash.

---

### âœ… **Step 6: Cloning the Repository with Submodules**
Next time, when you (or someone else) clones your main repo, use:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <your-main-repo-url>
```
If they already cloned it but didn't initialize submodules, they should run:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

### ðŸ”¥ **Now your submodule is properly added and tracked!**
Let me know if you run into any issues. ðŸš€

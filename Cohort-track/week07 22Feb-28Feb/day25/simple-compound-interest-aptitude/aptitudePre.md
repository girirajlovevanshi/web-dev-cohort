# Simple and Compound Interest - Aptitude Guide

## Simple Interest (SI)
### Formula:
```
SI = (P Ã— R Ã— T) / 100
```
Where:
- **P** = Principal (Initial Amount)
- **R** = Rate of Interest per annum (% per year)
- **T** = Time (in years)

### Example:
If you invest **â‚¹1000** at an interest rate of **5% per annum** for **3 years**, then:
```
SI = (1000 Ã— 5 Ã— 3) / 100 = â‚¹150
```
Total amount after 3 years = **Principal + SI = â‚¹1000 + â‚¹150 = â‚¹1150**

## Compound Interest (CI)
### Formula:
```
CI = P Ã— (1 + R/100)^T - P
```
Where:
- **P** = Principal
- **R** = Rate of Interest per annum
- **T** = Time (in years)

### Example:
If you invest **â‚¹1000** at an interest rate of **5% per annum** for **3 years**, then:
```
Amount = 1000 Ã— (1 + 5/100)^3
       = 1000 Ã— (1.05)^3
       = 1000 Ã— 1.157625
       = â‚¹1157.63
CI = Amount - Principal
   = 1157.63 - 1000
   = â‚¹157.63
```
Total amount after 3 years = **â‚¹1157.63**

## Difference Between Simple and Compound Interest
| Feature           | Simple Interest (SI)      | Compound Interest (CI)    |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Growth Type     | Linear                 | Exponential            |
| Interest Calculation | On the principal amount only | On principal + accumulated interest |
| Formula         | SI = (P Ã— R Ã— T) / 100 | CI = P Ã— (1 + R/100)^T - P |
| Final Amount    | A = P + SI             | A = P(1 + R/100)^T     |

## Aptitude - Interest Problems Tips
1. **For Quick SI Calculation**:
   - Use the formula directly and break down multiplication into smaller parts for faster mental calculations.

2. **For Quick CI Calculation**:
   - If the time is **2 years**, use:
     ```
     CI = P Ã— [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]
     ```
   - If the time is **3 years**, use:
     ```
     CI = P Ã— [(1 + R/100)^3 - 1]
     ```

3. **Shortcut for Interest Difference**:
   - The difference between CI and SI for **2 years** is given by:
     ```
     Difference = P Ã— (R/100)^2
     ```
   - For **3 years**, the formula is:
     ```
     Difference = P Ã— (R/100)^2 Ã— (3 + R/100)
     ```

4. **Common Interest Rates Multiplication Table**:
   - Memorize interest values for common rates like **5%, 10%, 15%** for faster problem-solving.
